## Event Summary

- EU AI Act enters into force and creates a staged compliance timeline; the near-term investable impact is not "EU AI stops", but a predictable shift toward compliance tooling, documentation-heavy deployment, and a moat for firms that can operationalize governance at scale, while smaller vendors face higher friction and delayed go-to-market in regulated use-cases.

- Gate: **Gate 2**

## Timeline (key nodes)

- 2024-03-13: EP_adopts_AI_Act_and outlines timeline for bans, GPAI, and high-risk rules
- 2024-05-21: Council_final_approval_of_AI_Act_and_summary_of_staged_application
- 2024-07-12: EU_AI_Act_published_in_Official_Journal_with_entry_into_force_and_staged_applicability

## Counter Hypotheses (3)

1) enforcement_delayed_or_narrowed
2) scope_limited_to_specific_use_cases
3) compliance_mitigation_reduces_impact

## Tripwire / Bound / Spiral

- First Tripwire: Publication_of_binding_EU-level_implementation_guidance + first high-profile enforcement/audit announcements
- Catastrophic Bound: Clear evidence that enforcement is symbolic (no cases, no audits, no procurement gating) for >18 months
- Death Spiral: Compliance_fear -> deployment_freeze -> delayed revenue -> reduced model investment -> falling competitiveness -> more reliance on incumbents

## 最短探针

- 48h: Capture the exact legal text on entry-into-force + staged applicability dates; map to a simple calendar
- 7d: Scan procurement policy updates in EU-regulated sectors for AI Act references (banks/health/public sector)
- 30d: Track whether regulators publish practical conformity assessment guidance and whether any audits are announced
