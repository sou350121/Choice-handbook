    EU AI Act enters into force and creates a staged compliance timeline; the near-term investable impact is not "EU AI stops",
    but a predictable shift toward compliance tooling, documentation-heavy deployment, and a moat for firms that can operationalize
    governance at scale, while smaller vendors face higher friction and delayed go-to-market in regulated use-cases.
  confidence: 0.6
  killer_assumptions:
    - EU_enforcement_is_real_and_not_purely_symbolic (meaningful fines / audits / procurement rules)
    - Buyers_in_regulated_sectors_treat_AI_Act_as_a_binding_risk_constraint (procurement + legal gating)
    - Compliance_tooling_spend_becomes_a_line_item (not absorbed silently with no vendor impact)
  market_map:
    channels:
      - AI_Act_deadlines -> procurement_checklists + model_cards + data_governance -> time_to_ship_increase
      - Compliance_burden -> demand_for_GRC/compliance_workflows + audit + red_teaming -> new_budget_lines
      - Regulatory_clarity -> incumbents_with_legal/infra_scale gain_relative_advantage over_small_vendors
    winners:
      - AI_governance/compliance_software (policy-as-code, model_registry, audit_trails)
      - Consulting/audit/red-teaming providers that operationalize conformity assessment
      - Large platforms with mature MLops + legal capacity (relative advantage)
    losers:
      - Small AI startups selling into regulated sectors without compliance muscle
      - Vendors relying on opaque training data / weak documentation
    watchlist:
      - EU_regulated_buyers (banks/insurance/healthcare/public_sector procurement)
      - AI_governance_tooling vendors and audit ecosystems
  scenarios:
    - name: Base_case_compliance_market_forms
      probability: 55%
      time_window: 6-18_months
      conditions: Regulators_publish_guidance; buyers_update_procurement; first enforcement cases appear
      description: Compliance becomes a gating checklist; spending shifts to tooling + services; deployment slows in high-risk domains
      impact: Compliance stack & services benefit; marginal AI vendors face longer sales cycles
    - name: Bull_case_regulatory_clarity_creates_moats
      probability: 25%
      time_window: 12-24_months
      conditions: Strong enforcement and standardized conformity assessment frameworks
      description: Clear rules reduce uncertainty; scale players win; compliant products gain trust and adoption
      impact: Incumbents/platforms outperform; compliant AI products penetrate regulated markets faster
    - name: Bear_case_symbolic_enforcement
      probability: 20%
      time_window: 6-24_months
      conditions: Weak enforcement; fragmented interpretation across member states; long delays
      description: Rules exist but are not enforced consistently; buyers treat it as paperwork only
      impact: Limited spend impact; thesis shifts to "noise" unless enforcement signals rise
  tripwire: Publication_of_binding_EU-level_implementation_guidance + first high-profile enforcement/audit announcements
  bound: Clear evidence that enforcement is symbolic (no cases, no audits, no procurement gating) for >18 months
  spiral: Compliance_fear -> deployment_freeze -> delayed revenue -> reduced model investment -> falling competitiveness -> more reliance on incumbents
  action:
    default: Track as Gate 2; build a watchlist of compliance stack beneficiaries and monitor procurement language changes
    if_tripwire: Upgrade to Gate 3; consider exposure to compliance ecosystem and scale incumbents; reduce exposure to fragile vendors in regulated GTM
    if_bound: Downgrade to Gate 1; treat as non-event for markets; stop spending time except for periodic checks
    hedges:
      - Pair trade: compliance-stack beneficiaries vs fragile regulated-sector AI vendors (conceptual)
      - Keep optionality: avoid directional bets until enforcement signals appear
  probes:
    48h: Capture the exact legal text on entry-into-force + staged applicability dates; map to a simple calendar
    7d: Scan procurement policy updates in EU-regulated sectors for AI Act references (banks/health/public sector)
    30d: Track whether regulators publish practical conformity assessment guidance and whether any audits are announced

uncertainties:
  - Exact staged applicability dates for each article set should be verified in the regulation text (do not rely on memory)
  - Enforcement intensity and member-state divergence can dominate outcomes
  - Market impact depends on where compliance spend accrues (in-house vs vendor ecosystem)
